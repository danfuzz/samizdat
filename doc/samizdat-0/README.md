Samizdat Layer 0
================

This is the specification for the language known as *Samizdat Layer 0*.
The language is meant to provide a syntactically and semantically
minimal way to build up and manipulate low-layer Samizdat data.

*Samizdat Layer 0* is run by translating it into low-layer Samizdat
data, as specified here, and running it with the specified core
library bindings.
