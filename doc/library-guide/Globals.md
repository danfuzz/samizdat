Samizdat Layer 0: Core Library
==============================

core::Globals / core::Globals0
------------------------------

The `Globals` module is special: It exports as its bindings all of the
global variables which are part of the standard evaluation environment.

As such, you will find it documented by virtue of what is exported as
globals from other modules as well as what is defined outside the context
of any module.

The `Globals0` module is an incomplete version of the `Globals` module, used
during initial system startup.
