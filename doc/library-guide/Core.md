Samizdat Layer 0: Core Library
==============================

Core
----

`Core` is the superclass of all low-level core classes. It defines
no methods. Its main utility is in allowing code to understand (and/or
limit) the values it is passed.

Notably, if a class inherits from `Core` it is guaranteed that there is
no other *different* class which also inherits from `Core` but has the
same name.
