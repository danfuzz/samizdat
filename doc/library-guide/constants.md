### In-Language Definitions

#### `null`

A value used when no other value is suitable, but when a value is
nonetheless required. It is defined as `@Null`, that is, a class-only
value with class tag `"Null"`.

#### `ENTITY_MAP`

Map of entity names to their string values. This is a map from strings to
strings, where the keys are XML entity names (such as `"lt" "gt" "zigrarr"`)
and the corresponding values are the strings represented by those entity
names (such as, correspondingly, `"<" ">" "‚áù"`).

The set of entities is intended to track the XML spec for same, which
as of this writing can be found at
<http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-entity-names/bycodes.html>.

**Syntax Note:** Used during the parsing of string literal forms.
