all boolean values.

### In-Language Definitions

#### `ENTITY_MAP`

Map of entity names to their string values. This is a map from strings to
strings, where the keys are XML entity names (such as `"lt" "gt" "zigrarr"`)
and the corresponding values are the strings represented by those entity
names (such as, correspondingly, `"<" ">" "‚áù"`).

The set of entities is intended to track the XML spec for same, which
as of this writing can be found at
<http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-entity-names/bycodes.html>.

**Syntax Note:** Used during the parsing of string literal forms.
