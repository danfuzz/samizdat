## Module file resolver
##
## This defines two types, that mirror the equivalent in the module system,
## one which does "internal" resolution and one which does "external"
## resolution.
##

export import ./external :: makeExternalResolver;
export import ./internal :: makeInternalResolver;
export import ./protocol :: resolve;

## This just causes method bindings to be made.
import ./nullResolver;
