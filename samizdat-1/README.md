Samizdat Layer 1
================

DEPRECATED.

The code here started out life as the *Samzidat Layer 1*
interpreter, including code to validate that translations to parse
trees done by this layer on *Samizdat Layer 0* code is identical to
the same trees as parsed directly by *samizdat-0*.

At this point, all of the parsing code has moved into the core library,
and the only thing that is left here is the validation piece.

TODO: Move validation into the library, or just kill this code entirely.
